## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I just learned how to make an image to be a link and a step above that, I added an overlay for the image. I also have learned quite a bit of flexbox from my previous challenge so I implemented it in making the card, the status, and footer. I also refreshed my memory on svgs.

New thing that i learned is about using css selecetor, it's somewhat complicated for my current part of learning, but I sure am going to keep practising to keep improve!

```css
a.image:hover>.overlay {
    background-color: hsl(190, 82%, 59%, .5);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to sharpen and fine-tune my flexbox knowledge. New stuff is the css selecetor using +, >, and ~. I sure am needing to learn and implement those things in my future projects!

### Useful resources

- [Shadow](https://shadows.brumm.af/) - This helped me for making smooth shadows. I really liked this site and will use it going forward.
- [Css Selector - W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me to try to understand the css selectors. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
